# heckel-diff

Project for learning C++. Inspired by IGListKit (https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit).

Based on Paul Heckel's linear time diffing paper (http://documents.scribd.com/docs/10ro9oowpo1h81pgh1as.pdf)

Feedback gratefully received.

Although the algorithm and tests (and their projects) are working, the example project is not, there is a linking issue at the moment.
